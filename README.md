A 10-minute Vue.js demo for class covering declarative rendering, reactivity, event handling, list rendering, and computed properties.  

## What you'll see  
- How to set up a Vue 3 app with a CDN script and the Composition API.  
- Declarative rendering using the mustache syntax.  
- Reactive state with `ref` and an array of tasks.
